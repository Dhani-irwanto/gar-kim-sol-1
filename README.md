an unreasonable and broken sequence created in Python, the calculation may take a very long time because the numbers here are very large or may overflow, here I will use 4 methods, namely addition, multiplication and exponentiation, you can set 3 variables namely result temp and kim, (akim, mkim, ekim and fkim depending on the category), this is a modification of the way to calculate tetration that I got in crtch and then modified it to python so things that don't make sense finally appear, the code can run well but it takes hundreds or even millions of years to calculate, it takes a computer with extraordinary power to calculate this, this is part of my googology
